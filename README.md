This is my personal portfolio, where I can share projects and information about myself.

## Objectives
* To produce a lightweight, simple static website that can be used to showcase my work.

## What I Learned
* Some basic features of aria attributes, which improve the accessibility of web content.
* How to optimize icon libraries like **[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)** by using tools such as [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io). Allowing you to package the minimum number of icons, and insert them as SVG elements.
* How to use Gulp to automate tedious tasks.
* The basics of using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) for a precompiler.

## Future plans
* Implement the projects section.
* Improve the navigation usability/style:
    * Make the navigation menu sticky with a transitioning background.
    * ~~Fix the dark hamburger close icon when the mobile menu overlay is open.~~
* Optimize the showcase background image using a blur-up technique.
* ~~This would be a good learning opportunity for **[SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)**. By converting the existing styling into SASS.~~
